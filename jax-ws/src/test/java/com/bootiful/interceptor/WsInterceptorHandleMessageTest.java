Scenario 1: Valid SOAP 1.1 message with correct credentials

Details:
  TestName: handleMessageWithValidSoap11AndCorrectCredentials
  Description: Test whether the handleMessage method processes a valid SOAP 1.1 message with correct username and password headers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a SoapMessage object with SOAP 1.1 version and set the HTTP header and SOAP headers with the correct username and password.
  Act: Invoke the handleMessage method with the arranged SoapMessage object.
  Assert: Verify that no exceptions are thrown.
Validation:
  Validate that the method completes without throwing a SoapFault when provided with valid credentials. This ensures that the authentication process is handled correctly for SOAP 1.1 messages.

Scenario 2: SOAP 1.1 message with missing credentials

Details:
  TestName: handleMessageWithSoap11AndMissingCredentials
  Description: Test whether the handleMessage method throws a SoapFault when provided a SOAP 1.1 message without username and password headers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a SoapMessage object with SOAP 1.1 version without setting the username and password SOAP headers.
  Act: Invoke the handleMessage method with the arranged SoapMessage object.
  Assert: Expect a SoapFault to be thrown.
Validation:
  Validate that a SoapFault is thrown when credentials are missing in the SOAP headers. This test ensures that the method enforces security by requiring credentials.

Scenario 3: SOAP 1.1 message with incorrect credentials

Details:
  TestName: handleMessageWithSoap11AndIncorrectCredentials
  Description: Test whether the handleMessage method throws a SoapFault when provided a SOAP 1.1 message with incorrect username and password headers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a SoapMessage object with SOAP 1.1 version and set the HTTP header and SOAP headers with incorrect username and password.
  Act: Invoke the handleMessage method with the arranged SoapMessage object.
  Assert: Expect a SoapFault to be thrown.
Validation:
  Validate that a SoapFault is thrown when incorrect credentials are provided. This test ensures that the method correctly rejects unauthorized access.

Scenario 4: Valid SOAP 1.2 message

Details:
  TestName: handleMessageWithValidSoap12
  Description: Test whether the handleMessage method can handle a SOAP 1.2 message without throwing an exception.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a SoapMessage object with SOAP 1.2 version.
  Act: Invoke the handleMessage method with the arranged SoapMessage object.
  Assert: Verify that no exceptions are thrown.
Validation:
  Validate that the method can process SOAP 1.2 messages. This test ensures that the handleMessage method is compatible with SOAP 1.2 version.

Scenario 5: SOAP 1.1 message with null message object

Details:
  TestName: handleMessageWithNullMessage
  Description: Test whether the handleMessage method can handle a null message object without throwing a NullPointerException.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the SoapMessage object to null.
  Act: Invoke the handleMessage method with a null SoapMessage object.
  Assert: Expect a NullPointerException or a relevant custom exception to be thrown.
Validation:
  Validate that the method throws an exception when provided with a null message object. This test ensures that the method has proper null checks in place.

Scenario 6: SOAP 1.1 message with empty username header

Details:
  TestName: handleMessageWithSoap11AndEmptyUsernameHeader
  Description: Test whether the handleMessage method throws a SoapFault when provided a SOAP 1.1 message with an empty username SOAP header.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a SoapMessage object with SOAP 1.1 version and set an empty username SOAP header.
  Act: Invoke the handleMessage method with the arranged SoapMessage object.
  Assert: Expect a SoapFault to be thrown.
Validation:
  Validate that a SoapFault is thrown when an empty username is provided in the SOAP headers. This test ensures that the method requires a non-empty username for authentication.

Scenario 7: SOAP 1.1 message with empty password header

Details:
  TestName: handleMessageWithSoap11AndEmptyPasswordHeader
  Description: Test whether the handleMessage method throws a SoapFault when provided a SOAP 1.1 message with an empty password SOAP header.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a SoapMessage object with SOAP 1.1 version and set an empty password SOAP header.
  Act: Invoke the handleMessage method with the arranged SoapMessage object.
  Assert: Expect a SoapFault to be thrown.
Validation:
  Validate that a SoapFault is thrown when an empty password is provided in the SOAP headers. This test ensures that the method requires a non-empty password for authentication.

    // Additional comment for clarification:
    // The error mentioned is related to a dependency resolution issue, not directly related to the test cases themselves. 
    // The project is missing the 'com.bootiful:framework:jar:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT' dependency, which might be a custom library required by the application.
    // To resolve this issue, ensure that the 'com.bootiful:framework' dependency is correctly installed or available in the local/remote repository.
    // This must be done before running the tests, as the tests might rely on classes or functionality provided by this missing dependency.
