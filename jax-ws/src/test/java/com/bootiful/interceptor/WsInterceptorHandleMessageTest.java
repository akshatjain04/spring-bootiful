Scenario 1: Valid SOAP 1.1 message with correct username and password

Details:
TestName: handleMessageWithValidCredentials
Description: This test ensures that the handleMessage method processes a SOAP 1.1 message with the correct username and password headers without throwing a fault.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock SoapMessage object of type Soap11 with the appropriate SOAP_ACTION, UNAME, and PWD headers. Mock the environment to return the expected username and password.
  Act: Invoke the handleMessage method with the mock SoapMessage object.
  Assert: Verify that no Fault is thrown.
Validation:
  This test validates that the method correctly authenticates a user with valid credentials and ensures the smooth operation of the service for authorized users.

Scenario 2: SOAP 1.1 message with missing SOAP action header

Details:
TestName: handleMessageWithMissingSoapAction
Description: This test checks if the handleMessage method properly handles a SOAP 1.1 message that lacks the SOAP_ACTION header.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock SoapMessage object of type Soap11 without the SOAP_ACTION header.
  Act: Invoke the handleMessage method with the mock SoapMessage object.
  Assert: Expect that no Fault is thrown since the SOAP_ACTION header is not mandatory for processing.
Validation:
  This test validates that the absence of the SOAP_ACTION header does not impede message processing, which could be the case for certain web service calls not requiring action specification.

Scenario 3: SOAP 1.1 message with incorrect username

Details:
TestName: handleMessageWithIncorrectUsername
Description: This test will check if the handleMessage method throws a fault when the provided username in the header does not match the expected username.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock SoapMessage object of type Soap11 with the correct SOAP_ACTION header but an incorrect UNAME header. Mock the environment to return the expected valid username and password.
  Act: Invoke the handleMessage method with the mock SoapMessage object.
  Assert: Verify that a Fault is thrown.
Validation:
  This test ensures that unauthorized access is prevented by invalid username credentials, which is critical for service security.

Scenario 4: SOAP 1.1 message with missing username header

Details:
TestName: handleMessageWithMissingUsername
Description: This test will ensure that the handleMessage method throws a fault when the SOAP message does not contain a username header.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock SoapMessage object of type Soap11 with the correct SOAP_ACTION header but no UNAME header.
  Act: Invoke the handleMessage method with the mock SoapMessage object.
  Assert: Verify that a Fault is thrown.
Validation:
  This test validates the method's ability to enforce the presence of authentication details, which is vital for maintaining secure access to the service.

Scenario 5: SOAP 1.1 message with empty password header

Details:
TestName: handleMessageWithEmptyPassword
Description: This test will check if the handleMessage method throws a fault when the SOAP message contains an empty password header.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock SoapMessage object of type Soap11 with the correct SOAP_ACTION header, a valid UNAME header, and an empty PWD header.
  Act: Invoke the handleMessage method with the mock SoapMessage object.
  Assert: Verify that a Fault is thrown.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the service rejects requests with incomplete authentication details, maintaining the security of the web service.

Scenario 6: Exception thrown retrieving credentials from environment

Details:
TestName: handleMessageWithEnvironmentException
Description: This test checks if the handleMessage method throws a fault when there is an exception while retrieving credentials from the environment.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock SoapMessage object of type Soap11 with the correct SOAP_ACTION, UNAME, and PWD headers. Mock the environment to throw an exception when getRequiredProperty is called.
  Act: Invoke the handleMessage method with the mock SoapMessage object.
  Assert: Verify that a Fault is thrown.
Validation:
  This test validates that the service handles exceptions during credential retrieval gracefully, ensuring that any system malfunction does not compromise security.

Scenario 7: SOAP 1.2 message handling

Details:
TestName: handleMessageWithSoap12
Description: This test verifies that the handleMessage method can handle a SOAP 1.2 message without throwing a fault, given that there is no specific logic implemented for SOAP 1.2 messages.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock SoapMessage object of type Soap12.
  Act: Invoke the handleMessage method with the mock SoapMessage object.
  Assert: Verify that no Fault is thrown.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the handleMessage method is compatible with SOAP 1.2 messages and does not disrupt processing when encountering such messages.

    The following errors are related to missing packages and classes that are not included in the provided test case. 
    These errors do not directly affect the test cases unless the missing classes are part of the business logic 
    that is being tested. If these classes are required for the WSInterceptor's handleMessage method logic, 
    the corresponding tests would fail. In such a scenario, the missing dependencies should be resolved in the 
    project setup, and the handleMessage method should be implemented accordingly.
