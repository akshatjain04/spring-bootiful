Scenario 1: Successful retrieval of users

Details:
  TestName: usersRetrievalSuccess
  Description: This test verifies that the users method returns a list of User objects successfully when the underlying service operates as expected.
  
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the dependencies if any and set up expected User objects to be returned.
  Act: Invoke the users method.
  Assert: Confirm that the returned list matches the expected list of User objects.

Validation:
  The assertion checks whether the list of User objects returned is what was expected, ensuring that the users method is functioning correctly in a successful scenario. The significance of the test lies in validating that the service can retrieve and return user data as intended.

Scenario 2: Handling of empty user list

Details:
  TestName: usersListEmpty
  Description: This test ensures that the users method can handle scenarios where there are no users to return, and it should return an empty list instead of null.

Execution:
  Arrange: Set up the scenario where no User objects are available to return.
  Act: Invoke the users method.
  Assert: Confirm that the returned list is empty and not null.

Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the method handles empty data gracefully by returning an empty list instead of a null reference, which is important to prevent NullPointerExceptions in the calling code.

Scenario 3: Exception handling

Details:
  TestName: usersExceptionHandling
  Description: This test checks if the users method properly throws a RuntimeException when an exception occurs during the execution of the method.

Execution:
  Arrange: Set up the scenario to throw an exception when attempting to retrieve users.
  Act: Invoke the users method and expect a RuntimeException.
  Assert: Confirm that a RuntimeException is thrown.

Validation:
  The assertion ensures that any underlying exceptions are not swallowed silently but are instead propagated as a RuntimeException, which is necessary for proper error handling and logging in the application.

Scenario 4: Logging verification

Details:
  TestName: usersLoggingVerification
  Description: This test case verifies that the users method logs an "Executing operation users" info message when called.

Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a logger to capture log messages.
  Act: Invoke the users method.
  Assert: Check that the appropriate log message has been recorded.

Validation:
  The assertion checks that the correct log message is output, which is crucial for tracking the method's execution in production environments and for debugging purposes.
