ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=getCurrentUser_42dfbda0b6

Scenario 1: HttpSession is null

Details:  
  TestName: getCurrentUserWithNullSession
  Description: This test verifies that the getCurrentUser method returns null when the HttpSession passed to it is null.
Execution:
  Arrange: N/A (No session to set up)
  Act: Call getCurrentUser with a null HttpSession.
  Assert: Assert that the returned User object is null.
Validation: 
  The assertion checks that when the method is provided with a null HttpSession, it adheres to the contract and returns null. This is significant because the method should handle null inputs gracefully without throwing exceptions, indicating robustness in the code.

Scenario 2: HttpSession is not null but does not contain a User

Details:  
  TestName: getCurrentUserWithSessionWithoutUser
  Description: This test checks if the getCurrentUser method returns null when the HttpSession does not have an attribute for the current user.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock HttpSession and ensure it does not have an attribute for CURRENT_USER.
  Act: Call getCurrentUser with this mock HttpSession.
  Assert: Assert that the returned User object is null.
Validation: 
  The assertion validates that the method correctly handles the case where the session does not contain a User object for the CURRENT_USER key. This is crucial for ensuring that the method does not falsely return a User when one is not set in the session.

Scenario 3: HttpSession contains a valid User object

Details:  
  TestName: getCurrentUserWithValidSessionAndUser
  Description: This test ensures that the getCurrentUser method returns the correct User object when the HttpSession contains a valid User attribute.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock HttpSession and set a mock User object as an attribute with the key CURRENT_USER.
  Act: Call getCurrentUser with this mock HttpSession.
  Assert: Assert that the returned User object is the same as the mock User set in the session.
Validation: 
  The assertion confirms that the method retrieves the correct User object from the session. This is essential for functionality that relies on obtaining the current user's information, such as authentication and authorization processes.

Scenario 4: HttpSession contains an attribute for CURRENT_USER but it is not of type User

Details:  
  TestName: getCurrentUserWithInvalidAttributeType
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the getCurrentUser method when the HttpSession has an attribute for CURRENT_USER, but it is not a User object.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock HttpSession and set a non-User object (e.g., a String) as an attribute with the key CURRENT_USER.
  Act: Call getCurrentUser with this mock HttpSession.
  Assert: Catch the ClassCastException and assert that it has been thrown.
Validation: 
  The assertion makes sure that the method throws a ClassCastException when the attribute under the CURRENT_USER key is not of type User. This test is vital for confirming that the method is type-safe and signals a clear error when an invalid type is encountered.

Scenario 5: HttpSession contains a valid User object, but the session is invalidated before retrieval

Details:  
  TestName: getCurrentUserWithInvalidatedSession
  Description: This test assesses the getCurrentUser method's resilience to a session that is invalidated (e.g., due to timeout) between the check for null and the retrieval of the user attribute.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock HttpSession, set a mock User object as an attribute, and then invalidate the session.
  Act: Call getCurrentUser with this invalidated HttpSession.
  Assert: Assert that the returned User object is null or handle the IllegalStateException that might be thrown due to session invalidation.
Validation: 
  The assertion checks how the method handles the edge case of a session becoming invalidated during the execution of the method. This scenario is important for ensuring that the method behaves correctly under race conditions that might occur in a multi-threaded environment.
