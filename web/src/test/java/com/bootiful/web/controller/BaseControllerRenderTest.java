Scenario 1: Rendering with non-empty base and valid view name

Details:
  TestName: renderWithValidViewName
  Description: This test checks if the render method correctly concatenates the viewBase with a given valid view name.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a String with a valid view name.
  Act: Invoke the render method with the initialized view name.
  Assert: Assert that the returned String is equal to the concatenation of viewBase and the view name.
Validation:
  Validate that the viewBase field prepends the view name correctly. This is significant as it ensures that the view paths are constructed properly, which is crucial for the framework to resolve views.

Scenario 2: Rendering with empty view name

Details:
  TestName: renderWithEmptyViewName
  Description: This test checks if the render method returns just the viewBase when an empty view name is provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a String with an empty value to represent the view name.
  Act: Invoke the render method with the empty view name.
  Assert: Assert that the returned String is equal to the viewBase.
Validation:
  Validate that the method can handle empty view names and still returns a valid path (just the base path). This test ensures that the method is robust and can handle edge cases gracefully.

Scenario 3: Rendering with null view name

Details:
  TestName: renderWithNullViewName
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the render method when null is passed as a view name.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the view name parameter to null.
  Act: Invoke the render method with a null view name.
  Assert: Assert that the returned String is equal to the viewBase or handle the NullPointerException if the implementation does not support null view names.
Validation:
  Validate that the method handles null inputs appropriately. This could either be returning the base path or throwing a predictable exception. This ensures that the method is safe to use even with invalid inputs.

Scenario 4: Rendering with special characters in view name

Details:
  TestName: renderWithSpecialCharactersInViewName
  Description: This test checks how the render method handles view names containing special characters.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a String with a view name that includes special characters (e.g., "home#about").
  Act: Invoke the render method with the special character-inclusive view name.
  Assert: Assert that the returned String correctly concatenates the viewBase and the view name with special characters.
Validation:
  Validate that the render method can handle view names with special characters without altering them. This is important for the correct resolution of views that may have special characters in their names.

Scenario 5: Rendering with leading/trailing spaces in view name

Details:
  TestName: renderWithLeadingTrailingSpacesInViewName
  Description: This test checks the render method's handling of view names with leading and trailing spaces.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a String with a view name that has leading and trailing spaces (e.g., "  home  ").
  Act: Invoke the render method with the view name with spaces.
  Assert: Assert that the returned String trims the spaces and correctly concatenates the viewBase and the trimmed view name.
Validation:
  Validate that the render method trims the view name before concatenation. This ensures that unintentional spaces do not affect the path resolution process.
