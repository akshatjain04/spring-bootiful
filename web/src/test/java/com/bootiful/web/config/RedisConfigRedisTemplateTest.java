Scenario 1: Successful creation of StringRedisTemplate with proper serializer

Details:  
TestName: ensureTemplateIsCreatedWithProperSerializer
Description: This test ensures that the StringRedisTemplate is created with the correct Jackson2JsonRedisSerializer and ObjectMapper configurations, including visibility and default typing settings.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the RedisConnectionFactory.
  Act: Call the redisTemplate method with the mocked RedisConnectionFactory.
  Assert: Verify that the returned StringRedisTemplate has a Jackson2JsonRedisSerializer set as its value serializer and that the ObjectMapper within the serializer is configured correctly.
Validation: 
  The assertion checks that the template's value serializer is an instance of Jackson2JsonRedisSerializer with the expected ObjectMapper configurations. This is important to ensure that the Redis data is serialized and deserialized correctly, allowing for proper handling of JSON objects.

Scenario 2: Ensure afterPropertiesSet is called

Details:  
TestName: verifyAfterPropertiesSetIsCalled
Description: This test verifies that the afterPropertiesSet method is called on the StringRedisTemplate after setting the serializer, which is necessary for proper initialization.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the RedisConnectionFactory and spy on a StringRedisTemplate instance.
  Act: Call the redisTemplate method with the mocked RedisConnectionFactory.
  Assert: Verify that afterPropertiesSet is called on the StringRedisTemplate instance.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to ensure that the StringRedisTemplate is fully initialized before use. Calling afterPropertiesSet is crucial because it finalizes the configuration of the template, which is a key step in the lifecycle of a Spring bean.

Scenario 3: Handling a null RedisConnectionFactory

Details:  
TestName: shouldThrowExceptionWhenConnectionFactoryIsNull
Description: This test checks that the redisTemplate method throws an appropriate exception when a null RedisConnectionFactory is provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Pass null for the RedisConnectionFactory parameter.
  Act: Attempt to invoke the redisTemplate method.
  Assert: Expect an exception to be thrown.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the method does not allow a null RedisConnectionFactory, which would lead to a non-functional RedisTemplate. This test ensures the robustness of the method against invalid input.

Scenario 4: Validate ObjectMapper visibility settings

Details:  
TestName: objectMapperVisibilitySettingsAreCorrect
Description: This test checks that the ObjectMapper used in the serializer has the correct visibility settings for all property accessors.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the RedisConnectionFactory.
  Act: Call the redisTemplate method with the mocked RedisConnectionFactory.
  Assert: Verify that the ObjectMapper has the expected visibility settings for all property accessors.
Validation: 
  The assertion confirms that the ObjectMapper is set up to handle all fields, regardless of their visibility modifiers, which aligns with the expected behavior for JSON serialization and deserialization in a Redis context.

Scenario 5: Validate ObjectMapper default typing settings

Details:  
TestName: objectMapperDefaultTypingSettingsAreCorrect
Description: This test ensures that the ObjectMapper is configured with the correct default typing to allow for proper type resolution of non-final classes during serialization.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the RedisConnectionFactory.
  Act: Call the redisTemplate method with the mocked RedisConnectionFactory.
  Assert: Verify that the ObjectMapper has the NON_FINAL default typing enabled.
Validation: 
  The assertion checks that the ObjectMapper is set up to handle polymorphic types during serialization, which is important for applications that store a variety of object types in Redis and expect them to be deserialized correctly.

Scenario 6: Ensure proper handling of exceptions during template initialization

Details:  
TestName: shouldHandleExceptionsDuringTemplateInitialization
Description: This test verifies that if an exception occurs during the initialization of the StringRedisTemplate (e.g., during the call to afterPropertiesSet), it is handled or propagated appropriately.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the RedisConnectionFactory and simulate an exception during the afterPropertiesSet invocation.
  Act: Call the redisTemplate method with the mocked RedisConnectionFactory.
  Assert: Expect an exception to be thrown or handled as per the method's exception handling policy.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to ensure that the method is robust against unexpected runtime issues during bean initialization and that such exceptions are not silently ignored, which could lead to a misconfigured or non-functional RedisTemplate.

Scenario 7: Verify the StringRedisTemplate bean scope

Details:  
TestName: stringRedisTemplateBeanScopeIsSingleton
Description: This test checks that the StringRedisTemplate bean created by the redisTemplate method has a singleton scope, ensuring that the same instance is reused across the application context.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the RedisConnectionFactory.
  Act: Call the redisTemplate method multiple times with the same mocked RedisConnectionFactory.
  Assert: Verify that the returned StringRedisTemplate instances are the same.
Validation: 
  The assertion ensures that only one instance of the StringRedisTemplate is created and managed by the Spring container, which is important for resource management and consistent data access patterns in the application.
