Scenario 1: User authentication failure with a valid username and increment of login failures count
Details:  
  TestName: incrementLoginFailuresOnBadCredentials
  Description: This test ensures that if a user with a valid username fails to authenticate, the loginFailuresCount is incremented by one.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the userRepository to return a user with a given username and a non-zero number of login failures.
  Act: Call onApplicationEvent with a AuthenticationFailureBadCredentialsEvent containing the mocked username.
  Assert: Verify that the userRepository's save method is called with a user whose loginFailuresCount is incremented by one.
Validation: 
  The assertion checks that the loginFailuresCount is correctly incremented, ensuring the system tracks consecutive login failures accurately.
  This test is significant as it helps prevent unauthorized access by keeping track of failed login attempts.
Scenario 2: User authentication failure with a valid username leading to account disabling after threshold
Details:  
  TestName: disableUserAfterConsecutiveFailures
  Description: This test verifies that a user's account is disabled after a predefined number of consecutive authentication failures.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the userRepository to return a user with four previous login failures.
  Act: Call onApplicationEvent with a AuthenticationFailureBadCredentialsEvent for the fifth consecutive failure.
  Assert: Verify that the userRepository's save method is called with a user whose account is set to disabled.
Validation: 
  The assertion confirms that after the threshold for login failures is reached, the user's account is disabled to secure the system against potential attacks.
  It is important to confirm that the application adheres to security policies regarding account lockouts after consecutive failed login attempts.
Scenario 3: User authentication failure with a non-existent username
Details:  
  TestName: noActionOnBadCredentialsWithNonexistentUsername
  Description: This test checks that the system does not perform any action when an authentication failure occurs for a non-existent username.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the userRepository to return null when a non-existent username is queried.
  Act: Call onApplicationEvent with a AuthenticationFailureBadCredentialsEvent containing a non-existent username.
  Assert: Verify that the userRepository's save method is never called.
Validation: 
  The assertion ensures that no changes are made for non-existent users, which could otherwise lead to null pointer exceptions or unnecessary processing.
  This test is significant as it ensures the system's stability and robustness when faced with authentication attempts for non-existent users.
Scenario 4: User authentication failure with additional login details provided
Details:  
  TestName: captureLoginDetailsOnAuthenticationFailure
  Description: This test ensures that when additional details are available during an authentication failure, these details are captured and stored in the user's record.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the userRepository to return an existing user and mock the event to provide WebAuthenticationDetails.
  Act: Call onApplicationEvent with a AuthenticationFailureBadCredentialsEvent that includes additional authentication details.
  Assert: Verify that the userRepository's save method is called with a user whose lastLoginDetails are updated with the provided details.
Validation: 
  The assertion checks that the additional login details are captured, which can be useful for auditing purposes and identifying suspicious activity.
  This test is relevant for maintaining a secure environment by monitoring login attempts and their associated metadata.
Scenario 5: User authentication failure without additional login details
Details:  
  TestName: handleNullAuthenticationDetailsOnFailure
  Description: This test ensures that the system can handle cases where no additional authentication details are provided during a login failure.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the userRepository to return an existing user and an AuthenticationFailureBadCredentialsEvent with null details.
  Act: Call onApplicationEvent with the event.
  Assert: Verify that the userRepository's save method is called with a user whose lastLoginDetails remain unchanged or null.
Validation: 
  The assertion confirms that the system does not fail or throw an exception when additional details are not provided.
  This test is important to ensure that the method is resilient and handles null authentication details gracefully.
