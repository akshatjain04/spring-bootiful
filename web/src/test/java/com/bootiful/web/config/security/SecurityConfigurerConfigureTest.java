Scenario 1: Ignoring static resources

Details:  
  TestName: ensureStaticResourcesAreIgnored
  Description: This test checks whether the configure method correctly sets the security to ignore all requests to static resources located under "/dist/**" path.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock of WebSecurity and its chained methods to test the ignoring of antMatchers.
  Act: Call the configure method with the mocked WebSecurity instance.
  Assert: Verify that the antMatchers method has been called with the "/dist/**" pattern and that the ignoring method has been invoked.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the static resources are not going through the security filters, which is expected as static resources typically do not require security checks. This is important to ensure that the application does not unnecessarily handle security for static content, improving performance.

Scenario 2: Ensuring no interaction with UserDetailsService

Details:  
  TestName: ensureUserDetailsServiceIsNotInvolved
  Description: This test ensures that the configure method does not interact with the UserDetailsService bean, as the method is only concerned with ignoring security for certain matchers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create mocks for WebSecurity and UserDetailsService. Ensure the UserDetailsService mock is set to the userDetailsService field of the class.
  Act: Call the configure method with the mocked WebSecurity instance.
  Assert: Verify that there has been no interaction with the UserDetailsService mock.
Validation: 
  The assertion checks that UserDetailsService is not used in the configure method, confirming that the method's responsibility is limited to setting web security configurations and is not interfering with user authentication mechanisms. This ensures separation of concerns within the configuration.

Scenario 3: Exception handling when configuration fails

Details:  
  TestName: ensureExceptionIsThrownWhenConfigurationFails
  Description: This test verifies that if an exception occurs during the execution of the configure method, it is correctly propagated up the call stack.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock of WebSecurity that throws an exception when any method is called.
  Act: Attempt to call the configure method with the mocked WebSecurity instance and catch any exceptions.
  Assert: Assert that an exception is caught and verify its type.
Validation: 
  This assertion confirms that the configure method does not swallow exceptions and that the correct exception handling behavior is maintained. It's important for the method to propagate exceptions to allow for proper error handling by the caller or the framework.

Scenario 4: Multiple patterns ignored

Details:  
  TestName: ensureMultiplePatternsCanBeIgnored
  Description: This test checks if it is possible to ignore multiple patterns by extending the configure method to ignore additional patterns and ensuring they are all accounted for.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock of WebSecurity and its chained methods to test ignoring of multiple antMatchers.
  Act: Modify the configure method to ignore additional patterns and call the method with the mocked WebSecurity instance.
  Assert: Verify that the antMatchers method has been called with all the specified patterns.
Validation: 
  The assertion ensures that the application can be configured to ignore security filters on multiple patterns, which is useful when there are several types of static content or endpoints that should not be secured. This ensures flexibility in security configurations.

Note: Scenario 4 requires a modification of the configure method, which might not be possible in a real testing scenario if you are not allowed to change the production code. However, it is included here for the sake of completeness in test coverage.
