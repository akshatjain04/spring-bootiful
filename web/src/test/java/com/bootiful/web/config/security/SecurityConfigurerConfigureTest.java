Scenario 1: Ensure Static Resources Are Not Secured
Details:  
  TestName: ensureStaticResourcesAreNotSecured
  Description: This test verifies that the configure method correctly sets up the WebSecurity to ignore security filters for static resources located under "/dist/**" path pattern.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the WebSecurity object and its chain of method calls.
  Act: Call the configure method with the mocked WebSecurity object.
  Assert: Verify that the ignoring method was called with the antMatchers method using the "/dist/**" path pattern.
Validation: 
  The assertion checks that the correct path pattern is passed to the antMatchers method. This is significant because it ensures that static resources are not subject to security filters, which could negatively impact performance and is generally unnecessary since they do not represent a security risk.
Scenario 2: Verify Method Throws No Exceptions
Details:  
  TestName: verifyMethodThrowsNoExceptions
  Description: This test ensures that the configure method does not throw any exceptions when called with a correctly setup WebSecurity object.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a WebSecurity object or mock it if necessary.
  Act: Call the configure method with the WebSecurity object.
  Assert: No exception is thrown.
Validation: 
  The lack of an exception indicates that the configure method operates as expected under normal conditions. This is crucial since exceptions at this level could prevent the application security configuration from being applied correctly.
Scenario 3: Verify Ignoring Method Is Called Once
Details:  
  TestName: verifyIgnoringMethodIsCalledOnce
  Description: This test is to check that the configure method calls the ignoring method exactly once to ensure that the configuration is not redundant or conflicting.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the WebSecurity object and its chain of method calls.
  Act: Call the configure method with the mocked WebSecurity object.
  Assert: Use a verification mechanism to ensure that the ignoring method is called exactly once.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the ignoring method is called only once, which is important to prevent unnecessary configuration overhead and potential conflicts within the security configuration.
Scenario 4: Verify Exception Handling When WebSecurity Is Misconfigured
Details:  
  TestName: verifyExceptionHandlingWhenWebSecurityIsMisconfigured
  Description: This test checks that the configure method correctly handles any exceptions that may arise if the WebSecurity object is misconfigured.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the WebSecurity object to throw an exception when the ignoring method is called.
  Act: Attempt to call the configure method with the mocked WebSecurity object.
  Assert: Expect an exception to be thrown.
Validation: 
  The assertion confirms that the configure method can handle unexpected exceptions gracefully, which is vital for maintaining the stability of the application when faced with misconfigurations in the security setup.
