ROOST_METHOD_HASH=passwordEncoder_2ce6df28b5
ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=passwordEncoder_be6d75f138

Scenario 1: Verify that the passwordEncoder bean returns a BCryptPasswordEncoder instance

Details:
  TestName: beanReturnsBCryptPasswordEncoder
  Description: This test verifies that the passwordEncoder bean method returns an instance of BCryptPasswordEncoder, ensuring that the application will use BCrypt hashing for encoding passwords.
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement is needed as the method has no dependencies or parameters.
  Act: Call the passwordEncoder method to obtain an encoder instance.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check that the returned object is an instance of BCryptPasswordEncoder.
Validation:
  The assertion confirms that the PasswordEncoder bean is correctly configured to return a BCryptPasswordEncoder. This is significant because the security of the application relies on the strength of the password encoding algorithm, and BCrypt is a widely accepted choice for security reasons.

Scenario 2: Ensure passwordEncoder bean is a singleton

Details:
  TestName: passwordEncoderBeanIsSingleton
  Description: This test ensures that the passwordEncoder bean method always returns the same instance of BCryptPasswordEncoder when invoked, adhering to the singleton pattern typically used in Spring beans.
Execution:
  Arrange: Invoke the passwordEncoder method to obtain the first instance.
  Act: Invoke the passwordEncoder method again to obtain a second instance.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check that both instances are the same.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the method returns a singleton instance, which is important for memory management and performance. It ensures that only one instance of the PasswordEncoder is created and reused throughout the application, preventing unnecessary object creation.

Scenario 3: Verify that the passwordEncoder bean integrates with AuthenticationManagerBuilder

Details:
  TestName: passwordEncoderIntegratesWithAuthenticationManagerBuilder
  Description: This test checks that the passwordEncoder bean can be successfully integrated with the AuthenticationManagerBuilder to set up the authentication mechanism in the application.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the AuthenticationManagerBuilder and UserDetailsService.
  Act: Configure the AuthenticationManagerBuilder to use the passwordEncoder bean and the mocked UserDetailsService.
  Assert: Verify that the AuthenticationManagerBuilder is configured with the correct PasswordEncoder.
Validation:
  This test validates that the configuration method properly sets up the PasswordEncoder for the authentication mechanism. It's essential to ensure that the authentication process uses the correct password encoding.

Scenario 4: Test that passwordEncoder bean throws no exceptions during bean creation

Details:
  TestName: passwordEncoderBeanCreationThrowsNoExceptions
  Description: This scenario tests that the passwordEncoder bean method does not throw any exceptions during the creation of the BCryptPasswordEncoder, ensuring the bean can be created without errors in the application context.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Attempt to invoke the passwordEncoder method.
  Assert: Assert that no exceptions are thrown during the invocation.
Validation:
  The lack of exceptions during bean creation is crucial for the reliable startup and operation of the application. This test ensures that the PasswordEncoder bean will not cause application context initialization to fail.

Scenario 5: Check that the strength of the BCryptPasswordEncoder is the default or as expected

Details:
  TestName: bcryptPasswordEncoderStrengthIsDefaultOrExpected
  Description: This test ensures that the BCryptPasswordEncoder created by the passwordEncoder bean has the default or a specified strength, which determines the security and computational cost of the hash function.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Retrieve the BCryptPasswordEncoder instance and check its strength property.
  Assert: Assert that the strength property matches the expected value.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the PasswordEncoder has the correct strength, which is important for balancing security and performance. A strength that is too low may compromise security, while a strength that is too high may cause performance issues during authentication.
