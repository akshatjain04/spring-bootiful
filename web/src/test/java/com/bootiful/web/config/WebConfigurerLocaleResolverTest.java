Scenario 1: Ensure default locale is set to Locale.US
Details:
  TestName: ensureDefaultLocaleIsSet
  Description: This test ensures that the SessionLocaleResolver bean created by the localeResolver method has its default locale set to Locale.US.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the method's class if necessary.
  Act: Call the localeResolver method to obtain the SessionLocaleResolver instance.
  Assert: Assert that the default locale of the SessionLocaleResolver instance is Locale.US.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: The test verifies that the default locale setting is correctly applied as per the method's implementation.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: Ensuring the default locale is crucial for the application to provide a consistent experience to users in the default region.
Scenario 2: Verify that the returned object is an instance of LocaleResolver
Details:
  TestName: returnedObjectIsLocaleResolverInstance
  Description: This test checks that the object returned by the localeResolver method is indeed an instance of the LocaleResolver interface.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the method's class if necessary.
  Act: Call the localeResolver method to obtain the object.
  Assert: Assert that the object is an instance of the LocaleResolver interface.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: The test confirms that the method returns an object that implements the expected interface, ensuring compatibility with the Spring framework.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: It is essential for Spring's locale resolution mechanism that the bean returned is a proper implementation of LocaleResolver.
Scenario 3: Check for the persistence of the locale between sessions
Details:
  TestName: localePersistsBetweenSessions
  Description: This test examines if the locale setting is persistent across different sessions, as the SessionLocaleResolver suggests.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create multiple mock session environments and instantiate the method's class if necessary.
  Act: Call the localeResolver method in different mock session contexts and set different locales.
  Assert: Assert that each session retains its specific locale setting.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: The test ensures that the locale settings are session-scoped and not globally shared or overwritten by other sessions.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: Session-based locale persistence is vital for a personalized user experience where users might have different locale preferences.
Scenario 4: Confirm behavior when session is not present
Details:
  TestName: behaviorWhenSessionNotPresent
  Description: This test verifies the behavior of the localeResolver method when there is no active session, ensuring that it still provides a default locale.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a context where no session is available.
  Act: Call the localeResolver method without an active session.
  Assert: Assert that the resolver still provides a default locale, expected to be Locale.US.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: The test checks that the localeResolver method gracefully handles the absence of a session and still provides a default locale.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: This test ensures that the application can handle requests without a session, which could be relevant for stateless clients or initial requests before a session is created.
