Scenario 1: Verify that the listRouteFiles method returns a non-empty list
Details:
  TestName: listRouteFilesReturnsNonEmptyList
  Description: This test checks if the listRouteFiles method returns a list that is not empty.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No arrangement is needed as the method does not depend on external input.
    Act: Call the listRouteFiles method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the returned list is not empty.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the method always returns a list with at least one element ("classpath:routes.conf"). This is significant as it confirms the method's contract to provide a list of route configuration files, which is essential for the router's initialization process.
Scenario 2: Verify the content of the returned list from listRouteFiles
Details:
  TestName: listRouteFilesContainsCorrectEntries
  Description: This test ensures that the list returned by the listRouteFiles method contains the expected file paths.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No arrangement is needed as the method does not depend on external input.
    Act: Call the listRouteFiles method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check that the list contains the specific entry "classpath:routes.conf".
  Validation:
    The assertion checks the content of the list to ensure that it contains the exact file path required for route configuration. This is important to ensure that the router is configured with the correct file and operates as expected.
Scenario 3: Verify the immutability of the returned list from listRouteFiles
Details:
  TestName: listRouteFilesReturnsImmutableList
  Description: This test verifies that the list returned by the listRouteFiles method cannot be modified.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Call the listRouteFiles method and store the returned list.
    Act: Try to add a new item to the stored list.
    Assert: Catch any UnsupportedOperationException thrown when attempting to modify the list and use JUnit assertions to verify that the exception is thrown.
  Validation:
    The assertion checks for immutability of the returned list. This is significant because it ensures that the list of route configuration files cannot be altered by the consumers of the method, which could potentially lead to unpredictable behavior of the routing system.
Scenario 4: Verify the consistency of the returned list from listRouteFiles across multiple calls
Details:
  TestName: listRouteFilesIsConsistentAcrossCalls
  Description: This test checks if multiple invocations of the listRouteFiles method return lists with the same content.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Call the listRouteFiles method twice and store the returned lists.
    Act: No action is required as the arrange step covers the invocation of the method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that both lists contain the same elements.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the method provides a consistent list of route configuration files across multiple calls. Consistency is important to ensure that the router is always configured in the same way, which is crucial for the stability and predictability of the application's routing behavior.
