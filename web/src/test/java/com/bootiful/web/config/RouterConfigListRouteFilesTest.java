```
Scenario 1: Verify that listRouteFiles returns a non-empty list

Details:
  TestName: ensureListRouteFilesIsNotEmpty
  Description: This test ensures that the listRouteFiles method returns a list containing at least one element.
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement is needed as the method does not depend on any external input or state.
  Act: Invoke the listRouteFiles method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check that the returned list is not empty.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the method always returns a list with at least one file path. This is significant because if the list were empty, it could indicate a configuration issue or a failure in the method logic.

Scenario 2: Verify the content of the returned list

Details:
  TestName: ensureListContainsCorrectRouteFiles
  Description: This test checks that the listRouteFiles method returns a list with the correct route configuration files.
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement is needed as the method does not depend on any external input or state.
  Act: Invoke the listRouteFiles method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check that the list contains the specific expected route file "classpath:routes.conf".
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the returned list contains the correct route configuration file. This is significant for the application to load the correct routing configuration and function as intended.

Scenario 3: Verify the immutability of the returned list

Details:
  TestName: ensureReturnedRouteFilesListIsImmutable
  Description: This test ensures that the list returned by listRouteFiles cannot be modified.
Execution:
  Arrange: Invoke the listRouteFiles method and store the result.
  Act: Attempt to add a new element to the stored list.
  Assert: Catch any UnsupportedOperationException thrown, or use JUnit assertions to check that the list size remains unchanged.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the returned list is immutable, which is significant to maintain the integrity of the application configuration and prevent accidental modifications at runtime.
```

Note: The provided method is quite simple and does not interact with external systems or have branches, so the number of meaningful test scenarios is limited. Additional scenarios might involve testing the method within the context of a larger application or system, but such tests would go beyond unit testing and require integration or system testing strategies.
