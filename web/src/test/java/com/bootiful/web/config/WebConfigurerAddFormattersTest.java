Scenario 1: Validate that custom formatters are added to the FormatterRegistry
Details:  
  TestName: ensureCustomFormattersAreAdded
  Description: This test ensures that custom formatters are correctly added to the FormatterRegistry passed to the addFormatters method.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock FormatterRegistry and define custom formatters that should be added.
  Act: Invoke the addFormatters method with the mocked FormatterRegistry.
  Assert: Verify that the custom formatters are added to the registry by checking if the addFormatter method on the mock registry is called with the correct formatter instances.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the addFormatters method correctly adds custom formatter objects to the FormatterRegistry. This is significant as it ensures that the application will correctly format data according to the custom formats provided, which is essential for consistent data representation throughout the application.
Scenario 2: Verify addFormatters does not throw exceptions when registry is empty
Details:  
  TestName: ensureNoExceptionsOnEmptyRegistry
  Description: This test checks that the addFormatters method does not throw any exceptions when called with an empty FormatterRegistry.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock FormatterRegistry with no formatters added.
  Act: Invoke the addFormatters method with the empty mock registry.
  Assert: Confirm that no exceptions are thrown during the execution of the method.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the method is robust and can handle cases where the registry does not have any formatters to begin with. This test is significant because it ensures the method's stability and reliability even in edge-case scenarios.
Scenario 3: Ensure addFormatters handles null input gracefully
Details:  
  TestName: ensureGracefulHandlingOfNullInput
  Description: This test ensures that the addFormatters method can handle a null input without throwing a NullPointerException.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the FormatterRegistry input to null.
  Act: Invoke the addFormatters method with null as the argument.
  Assert: Check that no exception is thrown and the method completes without error.
Validation: 
  The assertion checks for the absence of an exception, verifying that the method is fault-tolerant when dealing with null input. This is important as it prevents potential crashes in the application if the method is inadvertently called with a null argument.
Scenario 4: Confirm that no changes are made when registry already contains custom formatters
Details:  
  TestName: ensureNoChangesWhenRegistryHasCustomFormatters
  Description: This test verifies that the addFormatters method does not alter the existing formatters in the registry if it already contains custom formatters.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock FormatterRegistry and add pre-existing custom formatters to it.
  Act: Invoke the addFormatters method with the mock registry containing custom formatters.
  Assert: Verify that the existing formatters remain unchanged in the registry after the method call.
Validation: 
  The assertion ensures that the method does not disrupt the current state of the registry if it is already populated with custom formatters. This test is important to confirm that the method respects the principle of least surprise by not altering existing configurations.
