Scenario 1: Successful login with valid credentials

Details:  
  TestName: successfulLoginWithValidCredentials
  Description: This test checks if a user can successfully log in with valid email and password credentials.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the UserDetailsService to return a valid UserDetails object when called with a valid email. Set up the HttpSecurity as required by the configure method.
  Act: Simulate a login attempt using the correct email and password parameters.
  Assert: Verify that the HttpSecurity context is updated to an authenticated state for the user.
Validation: 
  The assertion confirms that a user with valid credentials is authenticated successfully. This is crucial as it ensures the login mechanism is functioning as expected, allowing access only to authenticated users.

Scenario 2: Login with invalid credentials

Details:  
  TestName: loginWithInvalidCredentials
  Description: This test verifies that an invalid login attempt with incorrect credentials results in a failure.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the UserDetailsService to throw a UsernameNotFoundException when called with an invalid email. Set up the HttpSecurity as required by the configure method.
  Act: Simulate a login attempt using incorrect email and password parameters.
  Assert: Verify that the HttpSecurity context remains unauthenticated and redirects to the failure URL.
Validation: 
  The assertion checks that an unauthenticated user is not granted access and is redirected to the login page with an error. It's important to test this scenario to prevent unauthorized access to the application.

Scenario 3: Logout and session invalidation

Details:  
  TestName: logoutAndSessionInvalidation
  Description: This test ensures that logging out invalidates the session and deletes the relevant cookies.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a valid authenticated security context and set up the HttpSecurity as required by the configure method.
  Act: Simulate a logout request using the configured logout URL.
  Assert: Verify that the session is invalidated, cookies are deleted, and the user is redirected to the logout success URL.
Validation: 
  The assertion validates that the logout process clears the user's session and removes security-sensitive cookies, which is essential for maintaining the security of the application after the user has logged out.

Scenario 4: Access control for authenticated users

Details:  
  TestName: accessControlForAuthenticatedUsers
  Description: This test checks if only authenticated users can access protected resources.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up the HttpSecurity with the configure method and mock an authenticated user.
  Act: Simulate an access attempt to a protected resource.
  Assert: Verify that the access is granted to the authenticated user.
Validation: 
  The assertion validates that the authorization configuration is correctly restricting access to authenticated users only. This is key to protecting sensitive resources from unauthorized access.

Scenario 5: CSRF protection disabled

Details:  
  TestName: csrfProtectionDisabledVerification
  Description: This test confirms that CSRF protection is indeed disabled as per the security configuration.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up the HttpSecurity as required by the configure method.
  Act: Simulate a request that would normally require CSRF protection if it were enabled.
  Assert: Verify that the request completes successfully without a CSRF token.
Validation: 
  The assertion checks that CSRF protection is disabled, which should be the case according to the method's configuration. It is important to validate this configuration to ensure that the application behaves as expected, especially if CSRF protection is intentionally disabled for specific scenarios.

These scenarios cover a range of situations that the `configure` method is designed to handle, from successful and unsuccessful authentication to session management and access control. Each scenario validates critical aspects of the security configuration, ensuring that the application's security mechanisms are functioning correctly.
