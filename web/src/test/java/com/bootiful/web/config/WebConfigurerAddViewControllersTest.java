Scenario 1: Verify that login view controller is correctly registered
Details:  
  TestName: ensureLoginViewControllerRegistration
  Description: This test ensures that the 'login' path is correctly mapped to the 'views/login' view by the addViewControllers method.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock ViewControllerRegistry object.
  Act: Call addViewControllers with the mocked ViewControllerRegistry.
  Assert: Verify that 'addViewController' is called with the 'login' path and that 'setViewName' is called with 'views/login'.
Validation: 
  The assertion confirms that the 'login' path is correctly associated with the 'views/login' view. This is significant because it ensures that users navigating to 'login' will be presented with the correct view.
Scenario 2: Verify that root view controller is correctly registered
Details:  
  TestName: ensureRootViewControllerRegistration
  Description: This test checks if the root path '/' is correctly associated with the 'views/index' view in the addViewControllers method.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock ViewControllerRegistry object.
  Act: Invoke the addViewControllers method with the mocked ViewControllerRegistry.
  Assert: Verify that 'addViewController' is called with the '/' path and that 'setViewName' is called with 'views/index'.
Validation: 
  Asserting this mapping ensures that navigating to the root of the application directs the user to the index view, which is crucial for the user's initial interaction with the application.
Scenario 3: Confirm that multiple view controllers can be registered
Details:  
  TestName: ensureMultipleViewControllerRegistration
  Description: This test checks if multiple view controllers can be registered within the same addViewControllers call.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock ViewControllerRegistry object.
  Act: Invoke the addViewControllers method with the mocked ViewControllerRegistry.
  Assert: Verify that 'addViewController' and 'setViewName' are called the correct number of times with the appropriate arguments.
Validation: 
  The assertion ensures that all specified view controllers are registered, which is essential for the application to respond to different URLs with the correct views.
Scenario 4: Validate exception handling when registry is null
Details:  
  TestName: ensureExceptionOnNullRegistry
  Description: This test verifies that the addViewControllers method handles a null ViewControllerRegistry argument appropriately, potentially throwing an IllegalArgumentException or similar.
Execution:
  Arrange: Pass a null value for the ViewControllerRegistry.
  Act: Attempt to invoke addViewViewControllers with null.
  Assert: Expect an exception to be thrown.
Validation: 
  This test confirms that the method is robust and handles null arguments without causing a NullPointerException, ensuring the stability of the application configuration process.
Scenario 5: Validate correct behavior with custom LocaleResolver
Details:  
  TestName: ensureCorrectBehaviorWithCustomLocaleResolver
  Description: This test ensures that addViewControllers works correctly when a custom LocaleResolver is present in the application context, which could potentially influence view resolution.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a custom LocaleResolver bean and add it to the application context. Mock ViewControllerRegistry.
  Act: Invoke the addViewControllers method.
  Assert: Verify that ViewControllerRegistry is used properly, regardless of the LocaleResolver configuration.
Validation: 
  This test checks if the presence of a custom LocaleResolver affects view controller registration, ensuring that the application supports internationalization without compromising view mapping.
These scenarios cover a range of tests from basic functionality to error handling and integration with other components. They ensure the method works correctly under various conditions and configurations, which is crucial for the reliability and maintainability of the web application.
